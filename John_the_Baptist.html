                        "In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest 
                        named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of 
                        Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron 
                        [the brother of Moses]. 
                        Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, 
                        observing all the Lord’s commands and decrees blamelessly. 
                        But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to 
                        conceive, and they were both very old."

                        "Once when Zechariah... was 
                        serving as priest before God... an angel...
                        appeared to him, standing at the right of the 
                        altar... When Zechariah saw him, he was 
                        startled and was gripped with fear. But the angel 
                        said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer 
                        has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, 
                        and you are to call him John."

                        because of his birth, for he will be great in the sight 
                        of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, 
                        and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born. 
                        He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.
                        And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, 
                        to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient 
                        to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”

                        “O Zechariah, We give you good news of a son, whose name is John, 
                        a name We have never given before.” He said, “My Lord, how can I have a son,

                        He said, “It will be so, your Lord says, ‘it is easy for me, and 
                        I created you before, when you were nothing.’” He said, 
                        “My Lord, give me a sign.” He said, “Your sign is that you will 
                        not speak to the people for three nights straight.” And he came 
                        to his people, from the sanctuary, and signaled to them to praise
                        morning and evening.

                        "But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his 
                        marriage to Herodias, his brother’s wife, and all the other 
                        evil things he had done, 20 Herod added this to them all: 
                        He locked John up in prison.
                    </p>

                            Mark Chapter 6:17-29</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, 
                        and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, 
                        his brother Philip’s wife, whom he had married. 
                        For John had been saying to Herod, 
                        “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” 
                            <br><br>
                        So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. 
                        But she was not able to, because Herod feared John and protected him, 
                        knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, 
                        he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him.
                            <br><br>
                        Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet 
                        for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. 
                        When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, 
                        she pleased Herod and his dinner guests.
                            <br><br>
                        The king said to the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I’ll give it to you.”
                        And he promised her with an oath, “Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.”
                            <br><br>
                        She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?”
                        “The head of John the Baptist,” she answered.
                        At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: 
                        “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”
                            <br><br>
                        The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, 
                        he did not want to refuse her. So he immediately sent an executioner with orders 
                        to bring John’s head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, 
                        and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, 
                        and she gave it to her mother. On hearing of this, John’s disciples came and 
                        took his body and laid it in a tomb.

                        “What should we do then?” the crowd asked. John answered,
